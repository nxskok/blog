<section><p>Last night, Megan and I went to the first ever home game of the Toronto Wolfpack. We got there early and grabbed seats about seven rows up from the field (general admission), so we were close enough to be near the action and yet high enough to get a sense of the flow of the game.</p>
<p>The opposition were a mid-table Oxford side, and as I said to Megan before the game, it’s not whether the Wolfpack would win, but by how many (the answer in the end was 62-12). It was kind of an odd feeling: a very Canadian stadium with stands at the side but not at the ends, national anthems before the game, an announcer encouraging us to support the “deee-fence” when Oxford got the ball, at half time a “hot-dog cannon” that we had seen at the Brampton Beast hockey game, and yet lots of rugby shirts of various persuasions, a lot of Wolfpack scarves, and someone periodically yelling “get ’em up, Ref” in a manner that made me feel as if I were on the other side of the Atlantic. People seemed to be enjoying the game (the fact that the home side were running in tries one after the other undoubtedly helped). There was what I called elsewhere “simmering resentment” between the two sides, which came out in a mass brawl near the end from which two players were sent off.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that Canadian fans used to hockey will like the physical nature of the sport. I think people unfamiliar with the game will find it easy enough to follow: pass the ball backwards until tackled, get up right away and start it off again, break the rules and the other side gets the ball. There is more detail, but that’s the idea. Certainly Megan enjoyed the tries and followed enough of the game to enjoy it (although the scrum is still a bit of a mystery to her). I like the fact that there is a genuine 2-times-40 minutes of action with very little hanging around, and the 10-minute halftime is short enough that you are not waiting around for things to start up again. (I don’t like the 15-minute half-time that round-ball has now; it always seems 5 minutes too long. When I were a lad, it were 10 minutes and like it.) Having seen the team on the CBC live feed a couple of times, I am starting to recognize the players by face as well as name, so it is becoming “my” team.</p>
<p>Megan also has a fine wolf howl, as she demonstrated. She enjoyed the game enough to be keen to go back in two weeks (when Barrow are the visitors, a much closer game in prospect). So I bought a ticket for her to go along with mine (kids’ tickets at $5 each are a steal).</p>
<p>The crowd was about 6,000, large enough to make it seem like a real event.</p>
<p>The stadium is in the city, along King Street, so it reminded me of long-ago trips to Villa Park or the Hawthorns to be, after the game, walking in a crowd along the street to get the train, or, in our case, a bus. The Dufferin bus was a bendy-bus, which was a good thing because it was jammed full of people from the game and others going to the subway. (Many Canadian stadiums of this kind are out in the suburbs surrounded by acres of parking, to which <em>everyone</em> drives, with predictable consequences when the game is over. This stadium, however, is very much of the city. There is parking, but a lot of people walked or rode the streetcar to the game.)</p>
<p>English rugby league in Canada. An audacious venture that deserves to succeed.</p>

      <description>In cricket, there are two ways to win a one-day game: by runs, if you bat first and score more runs than the other guys, or by wickets, if you bat second and score more runs than the other guys: at the moment where the second team has more runs, the game ends, and the result is given as “won by 6 wickets with 12 balls remaining”, or similar.</description>

      <description>Introduction Carter and Guthrie, in 2004, proposed a method of modelling cricket matches. Their aim was to provide an alternative method of deciding interrupted matches, in the manner of Duckworth and Lewis. What was interesting to me is that they estimate a probability of winning (which is then held fixed over interruptions), and it seemed to me that one could estimate and update the probability of winning as the game progresses, which would be a useful adjunct for spectators.</description>

      <description>Estimating the parameters Start, as ever, with the tidyverse, along with MASS for modelling later:

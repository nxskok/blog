      <description>yes  Introduction Do you follow @londonmapbot on Twitter? You should. Every so often a satellite photo is posted of somewhere in London (the one in England), with the implied invitation to guess where it is. Along with the tweet is a link to openstreetmap, and if you click on it, it gives you a map of where the photo is, so you can see whether your guess was right.</description>

      <description>Introduction I have long been interested in drawing maps, and when I discovered how to do it in R, I have tried to add it to my statistical repertoire, including drawing things on maps. There are two packages that can be used to obtain maps and draw on them, ggmap which is based on Google Maps, and OpenStreetMap which is based on Open Street Maps (surprisingly enough). They have overlapping capabilities, which we will explore here.</description>

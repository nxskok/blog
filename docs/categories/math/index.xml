      <description>While waiting for my coffee at work this morning, I was leafing through a recreational mathematics journal. It said, “the numbers 1–9 are arranged at random in a 3 by 3 matrix. What is the probability that the row sums and column sums are all odd?”
Well, I thought, that ought to be easy enough to simulate. Randomly shuffle the numbers 1–9 using sample, and then insert them into a matrix with three columns.</description>

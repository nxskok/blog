      <description>What’s in here This is a rather long and complicated post. Here are some of the things you’ll find here:
 about rugby league extracting data from text making dates with lubridate and using fill to copy them to empty rows tidyr::extract making a Bayesian model with Stan rstan using left_join to look up values in another table fct_reorder and ordering boxplots by median   Introduction Rugby league is one of the “football” family of sports, in which players gain ground by carrying and passing and kicking the ball (like rugby union, North American football and somewhat like Australian and Gaelic football).</description>

A Bayesian model has two parts: a prior distribution, which summarizes your belief about the parameters you are trying to estimate before you look at any data, and a model that asserts the data-generating mechanism conditional on the parameter value(s).</description>

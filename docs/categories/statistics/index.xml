      <description>Most software, when you ask it to draw you a histogram, will choose a number of intervals (“bins”) for you. Base R is one of those. To illustrate, let’s read in some data:
library(tidyverse) ## Loading tidyverse: ggplot2 ## Loading tidyverse: tibble ## Loading tidyverse: tidyr ## Loading tidyverse: readr ## Loading tidyverse: purrr ## Loading tidyverse: dplyr ## Conflicts with tidy packages ---------------------------------------------- ## filter(): dplyr, stats ## lag(): dplyr, stats soap=read_delim(&amp;quot;soap.</description>

      <description>Introduction Carter and Guthrie, in 2004, proposed a method of modelling cricket matches. Their aim was to provide an alternative method of deciding interrupted matches, in the manner of Duckworth and Lewis. What was interesting to me is that they estimate a probability of winning (which is then held fixed over interruptions), and it seemed to me that one could estimate and update the probability of winning as the game progresses, which would be a useful adjunct for spectators.</description>

      <description>I just discovered a couple of things:
an R Studio add-in called CRANsearcher that, when you run it, prompts you for search terms and searches the whole of CRAN for anything that matches those search terms. (Thanks to @juliasilge on Twitter for this.)
 This inspired me to see what else was on my AddIns menu in R Studio. I also found options for creating a new blog post and “serving the site” so I can preview it.</description>

      <title>Welch analysis of variance</title>

      <description>Introduction The standard analysis of variance based on the \(F\)-test has two major assumptions:
Normally distributed data Equal variance within each group.  The analysis can handle a certain amount of non-normality, but the equal-variance assumption is important because it is required for the idea of “an” error variance to make sense (that is what the error mean square is estimating).
Is it possible to make an ANOVA that can allow for the groups to have different variances?</description>

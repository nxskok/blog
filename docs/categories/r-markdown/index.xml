      <description>Introduction One of the courses I teach is called Applications of Statistical Methods. It uses (mostly) familiar statistical techniques to provide the background for an introduction to R and SAS. (Students taking it have a course in statistical inference, but I find the ideas of that havenâ€™t typically stuck very well.) In previous years, I have introduced both R and SAS at the same time, which posed a challenge for constructing lecture notes and assignment solutions: how do you run code, that might be in either language, and get the output, without a great deal of copying and pasting?</description>

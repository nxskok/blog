      <description>Introduction In a previous post, I was trying to estimate the volume of wood in a tree from its diameter, and I noted that it would be an advantage to know the height of the tree: for example, we could pretend the tree was cone-shaped, or use a power-law-type relationship in which we estimate the best powers of diameter and height to use to estimate volume.
Which made me wonder, how do you measure the height of a tree anyway?</description>

      <description>This morningâ€™s Heritage Walk was in Kensington Market. I grabbed a few photos.
This is the Church of St Stephen-in-the-Fields, on College between Spadina and Bathurst:
Though it is now thoroughly of downtown, when it was built (1857), it was literally in the fields. However, its mission is still the same as it was, to help new immigrants and those of the area that need help. This was a theme of the walk: the various waves of immigrants who settled the area built institutions to help their fellows out.</description>

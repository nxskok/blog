      <description>Introduction Thomas Lin Pedersen is the author of a lot of packages, including two that deal with graphs (in the sense of networks), tidygraph for storing and handling graphs, and ggraph for drawing them, ggplot-style. I have a feeling I will be spending a lot of time with tidygraph, but in this post, I get my feet wet reading in and storing a graph and then making a picture of it.</description>

      <description>Introduction I have long been interested in drawing maps, and when I discovered how to do it in R, I have tried to add it to my statistical repertoire, including drawing things on maps. There are two packages that can be used to obtain maps and draw on them, ggmap which is based on Google Maps, and OpenStreetMap which is based on Open Street Maps (surprisingly enough). They have overlapping capabilities, which we will explore here.</description>

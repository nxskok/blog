      <description>Introduction The other day, I wanted to download all of this season’s results in the Icelandic soccer league. I’m sure you often want to do this. Or, more seriously, you want to grab something from a web page, but something is standing in the way of making it simple. In this post, we explore the use of rvest for this task, along with RSelenium, which we need for the more sophisticated stuff later.</description>

      <description>Introduction I was reading this by Sara Stoudt and Kellie Ottoboni, and, looking at Kellie’s analysis, I wondered “how would I do it”, realizing that there are many ways to do things in the Tidyverse world. Kellie was kind enough to share her data, so I could go right ahead and experiment.
Let’s load the tidyverse and read in the data: ⊕I used “read_csv” from “readr” which avoids having to do the “stringsAsFactors” thing.</description>

      <guid>/2018/06/13/tidy-matched-pairs-t-test/</guid>
      <description>Introduction The matched pairs \(t\)-test is for comparing two measurements obtained on the same individual, such as a before and an after measurement. This is different from the two-sample \(t\)-test, which has two independent sets of measurements, one for each experimental condition, with each set collected on different individuals. The matched-pairs \(t\)-test is typically the first time we meet repeated-measures data (more than one measurement on the same individual, collected at different times or under different conditions), but we sidestep having to learn anything too new by looking at the difference between the two measurements on the same individual, thus turning the two measurements for each individual into one.</description>

      <description>Introduction Somebody mentioned ANOSIM to me, and I had this kind of vague recollection of it, meaning that I didn’t really understand anything of it at all. This prompted me to explore further, which got me into the vegan package. This contains a number of functions for handling ecological community data. One of these is anosim, or “analysis of similarity”, which is used for assessing the groupings of objects when we have only a dissimilarity matrix: are the objects within a group more similar than ones in different groups?</description>

      <guid>/2018/04/12/tidy-chi-squared-testing/</guid>
      <description>Introduction R has the creaky old functions table and chisq.test for counting up frequencies and doing chi-squared tests for association. They work, but there is nothing very tidyverse or elegant about them. Nonetheless, if we organize things right, we can use them in a tidy way, with everything working with data frames and pipelines.

      <guid>/2018/04/11/ordered-alternatives-in-anova/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Standard analysis of variance, and nonparametric alternatives to it such as the Kruskal-Wallis test, test a null hypothesis of “all the groups have the same mean” against a vague alternative of “two or more of the groups have different means”. We typically carry out ANOVA in two stages: do the \(F\)-test or Kruskal-Wallis, and, having rejected the null that all the groups are the same, then carry out a multiple-comparisons method such as Tukey’s to determine which groups differ from which.</description>

      <description>On a dare from @dataandme and @littlemissdata, last night I bought the domain ritsokiguess.site, and now this blog lives there (as well as at the old nxskok.github.io, which is the “actual” home for the site). I used, extensively, Brooke Watson’s guide, for which many thanks. There seems to need to be a two-way connection between where the static website actually lives, and where it looks to the outside world as if it lives.</description>

      <guid>/2018/03/25/today-on-twitter-i-learned/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Today on Twitter I learned (or was reminded about) two #rstats things:
from @pkqstr about separate_rows from tidyr, that does something like separate followed by gather, but better. from @ma_salmon about haven for reading in data files from other software, and I thought about rio that does more or less the same thing, but more generally.  I didn’t come up with an answer to Maëlle’s question of why haven worked less well for me than rio a long time ago.</description>

      <description>Introduction I don’t know yet where this post is going. Think of it, for now, as a ramble through cluster analysis. I may eventually figure out what to do with it, but I don’t want to delete what I have written just yet.
Hierarchical clustering is a way of forming groups or “clusters” of like individuals. The various forms of hierarchical clustering work from distances or dissimilarilities between individuals. The process is to start from each individual in a cluster by itself and then to join the closest pair of clusters one by one until all individuals are in a single cluster.</description>

      <guid>/2018/02/28/working-my-way-back-to-you-a-re-investigation-of-rstan/</guid>
      <description>Introduction I learned Stan a while back, when I was fitting some Bayesian models. I wanted to fix up one of them, and I realized that I had forgotten most of what I knew about Stan, so I had to go back and learn it again.
A Bayesian model has two parts: a prior distribution, which summarizes your belief about the parameters you are trying to estimate before you look at any data, and a model that asserts the data-generating mechanism conditional on the parameter value(s).</description>

      <guid>/2018/02/23/making-a-lot-of-plots-all-at-once-the-tidyverse-way/</guid>
      <description>Introduction I was thinking the other day about how you might come up with a bunch of separate-but-related plots, without plotting them one by one, for example to show a class.
By way of example, suppose we want to plot a number of Poisson distributions with different means, so that we can compare their shapes. The textbook says that a Poisson with a large mean is “approximately normal”, but that is just words until you see it on a picture.</description>

      <guid>/2018/01/30/tidy-simple-effects-in-analysis-of-variance/</guid>
      <description>Introduction In two-way analysis of variance, the (continuous) response variable depends on two explanatory factors, say A and B. These factors might have an additive effect, in which case you can talk unambiguously about “the effect of factor A”, but the effect of factor A might be different depending on what level of factor B you are looking at. In that case, factors A and B are said to have an interaction.</description>

      <description>Introduction David Selby, on his blog, explains how to get R up and running on your Android phone (and, by way of proof, wrote the blog post concerned on his phone). Unfortunately, however, he was only able to install R 3.1.1, which means that some of the latest tidyverse goodies are not available. Can we do better? It is possible. Maybe.
 Installation on the Android phone We begin by installing two Android apps, which can both be found on Google Play.</description>

      <description>Introduction I have long been interested in drawing maps, and when I discovered how to do it in R, I have tried to add it to my statistical repertoire, including drawing things on maps. There are two packages that can be used to obtain maps and draw on them, ggmap which is based on Google Maps, and OpenStreetMap which is based on Open Street Maps (surprisingly enough). They have overlapping capabilities, which we will explore here.</description>

      <description>Introduction One of the things my environmental science colleagues spend much of their time doing is assessing whether something is changing over time. Most commonly, the depressing conclusion from one of their investigations is “climate change”. One of the studies I was part of concerned temporal trends in sea ice in Hudson Bay. We will see some of that data later on.
There are two major tools that environmental scientists typically use to assess trend:</description>

Google’s transit directions are an example: you enter a start and an end point, and it tells you which vehicles to get and where to transfer to another one. Nowadays, this is a commonplace. But back in 1989, the idea of “shortest path” was an idea in the minds of graph theorists, not a practical way to get from one place to another.</description>

      <description>Introduction In cricket, a Manhattan chart records how many runs a team score in each over (and how many wickets fall). An example is here (scroll down to find it). Is it possible to extract the numbers of runs and wickets for each team from this graph?
The answer turns out to be “yes”, because this graph is an SVG graphic, and the data used to create it is embedded in the HTML code, so it is “simply” a matter of pulling it out.</description>

To be specific, let’s suppose we have these values of \(n\):
n=c(10,15,20) and these values of \(p\):
p=c(0.25,0.3,0.42) We’ll need the tidyverse, as usual:</description>

      <description>Introduction broom is supposed to be a powerful way to summarize several models at once, and so it is. The trouble is, the examples show how to fit the same model to different subsets of a data set. I had something different in mind: I had one data set, and three different models on that same data. Could I do something similar there? It wasn’t clear to me how.
 Illustrative data The data here came from Albright’s book.</description>

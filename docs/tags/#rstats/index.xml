      <description>Introduction broom is supposed to be a powerful way to summarize several models at once, and so it is. The trouble is, the examples show how to fit the same model to different subsets of a data set. I had something different in mind: I had one data set, and three different models on that same data. Could I do something similar there? It wasn’t clear to me how.
 Illustrative data The data here came from Albright’s book.</description>

      <description>Introduction Let’s suppose we are trying to find the median of a bunch of binomial distributions. ⊕This is a simplified version of an actual problem I had, but that one fails for some unconnected (and thus far unknown) reason, so I don’t want to show you that.
To be specific, let’s suppose we have these values of \(n\):
n=c(10,15,20) and these values of \(p\):
p=c(0.25,0.3,0.42) We’ll need the tidyverse, as usual:</description>

      <description>Introduction broom is supposed to be a powerful way to summarize several models at once, and so it is. The trouble is, the examples show how to fit the same model to different subsets of a data set. I had something different in mind: I had one data set, and three different models on that same data. Could I do something similar there? It wasn’t clear to me how.
 Illustrative data The data here came from Albright’s book.</description>

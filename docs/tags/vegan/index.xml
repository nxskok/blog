      <description>Introduction Somebody mentioned ANOSIM to me, and I had this kind of vague recollection of it, meaning that I didn’t remember anything of it at all. This prompted me to explore further, which got me into the vegan package. This contains a number of functions for handling ecological community data. One of these is anosim, or “analysis of similarity”, which is used for assessing the groupings of objects when we have only a dissimilarity matrix: are the objects within a group more similar than ones in different groups?</description>

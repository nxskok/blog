      <description>yes  Introduction Do you follow @londonmapbot on Twitter? You should. Every so often a satellite photo is posted of somewhere in London (the one in England), with the implied invitation to guess where it is. Along with the tweet is a link to openstreetmap, and if you click on it, it gives you a map of where the photo is, so you can see whether your guess was right.</description>

      <description>Introduction A chisquare test can be used for assessing whether there is association between two categorical variables. The problem it has is that knowing that an association exists is only part of the story; we want to know what is making the association happen. This is the same kind of thing that happens with analysis of variance: a significant \(F\)-test indicates that the group means are not all the same, but not which ones are different.</description>

      <description>Today (or, at least, recently) I learned:  Stan You can open up a .stan file of Stan code in R Studio, and the syntax gets nicely highlighted for you. Also, there is a Check button, which checks that your file is syntactically correct before you try to compile it.
In addition, I finally got my head around (fixed effects) ANOVA Bayesian-style, but that is a blog post for another time.</description>

      <description>I had a go at Xaringan to make a small and pointless presentation. Here is the presentation, and here is the R Markdown that produced it.
The whole Github repo is an R Studio project. Feel free to clone it and play with it.
I got the pdf of the presentation by printing the HTML to pdf in Chrome. (It seems to be easier to share the pdf than share the HTML, because the latter requires extra stuff with it.</description>

      <description>Introduction The other day, I wanted to download all of this season’s results in the Icelandic soccer league. I’m sure you often want to do this. Or, more seriously, you want to grab something from a web page, but something is standing in the way of making it simple. In this post, we explore the use of rvest for this task, along with RSelenium, which we need for the more sophisticated stuff later.</description>

      <description>Introduction One of the courses I teach is called Applications of Statistical Methods. It uses (mostly) familiar statistical techniques to provide the background for an introduction to R and SAS. (Students taking it have a course in statistical inference, but I find the ideas of that haven’t typically stuck very well.) In previous years, I have introduced both R and SAS at the same time, which posed a challenge for constructing lecture notes and assignment solutions: how do you run code, that might be in either language, and get the output, without a great deal of copying and pasting?</description>

      <description>Introduction I was reading this by Sara Stoudt and Kellie Ottoboni, and, looking at Kellie’s analysis, I wondered “how would I do it”, realizing that there are many ways to do things in the Tidyverse world. Kellie was kind enough to share her data, so I could go right ahead and experiment.
Let’s load the tidyverse and read in the data: ⊕I used “read_csv” from “readr” which avoids having to do the “stringsAsFactors” thing.</description>

      <description>Did somebody say dates? Well, actually not those. I meant the other kind.
 Some birth dates Let’s suppose that we have some people and their birth dates, and we want to know how old they are:

      <description>Introduction The data set that inspired this post comes from this edition of Mendenhall and Sincich. It comes from an investigation of how you learn people’s names effectively. 139 students were randomly divided into three groups, and had to learn the first and last names of all the people in the group they had been randomized to (between 40 and 50 other students). The study investigated three methods of learning names:</description>

      <guid>/2018/06/13/tidy-matched-pairs-t-test/</guid>
      <description>Introduction The matched pairs \(t\)-test is for comparing two measurements obtained on the same individual, such as a before and an after measurement. This is different from the two-sample \(t\)-test, which has two independent sets of measurements, one for each experimental condition, with each set collected on different individuals. The matched-pairs \(t\)-test is typically the first time we meet repeated-measures data (more than one measurement on the same individual, collected at different times or under different conditions), but we sidestep having to learn anything too new by looking at the difference between the two measurements on the same individual, thus turning the two measurements for each individual into one.</description>

      <description>Introduction Somebody mentioned ANOSIM to me, and I had this kind of vague recollection of it, meaning that I didn’t really understand anything of it at all. This prompted me to explore further, which got me into the vegan package. This contains a number of functions for handling ecological community data. One of these is anosim, or “analysis of similarity”, which is used for assessing the groupings of objects when we have only a dissimilarity matrix: are the objects within a group more similar than ones in different groups?</description>

      <description>Introduction R has the creaky old functions table and chisq.test for counting up frequencies and doing chi-squared tests for association. They work, but there is nothing very tidyverse or elegant about them. Nonetheless, if we organize things right, we can use them in a tidy way, with everything working with data frames and pipelines.

      <description>Introduction Standard analysis of variance, and nonparametric alternatives to it such as the Kruskal-Wallis test, test a null hypothesis of “all the groups have the same mean” against a vague alternative of “two or more of the groups have different means”. We typically carry out ANOVA in two stages: do the \(F\)-test or Kruskal-Wallis, and, having rejected the null that all the groups are the same, then carry out a multiple-comparisons method such as Tukey’s to determine which groups differ from which.</description>

      <description>Introduction I don’t know yet where this post is going. Think of it, for now, as a ramble through cluster analysis. I may eventually figure out what to do with it, but I don’t want to delete what I have written just yet.
Hierarchical clustering is a way of forming groups or “clusters” of like individuals. The various forms of hierarchical clustering work from distances or dissimilarilities between individuals. The process is to start from each individual in a cluster by itself and then to join the closest pair of clusters one by one until all individuals are in a single cluster.</description>

By way of example, suppose we want to plot a number of Poisson distributions with different means, so that we can compare their shapes. The textbook says that a Poisson with a large mean is “approximately normal”, but that is just words until you see it on a picture.</description>

These factors might have an additive effect, in which case you can talk unambiguously about “the effect of factor A”, but the effect of factor A might be different depending on what level of factor B you are looking at. In that case, factors A and B are said to have an interaction.</description>

      <description>In cricket, there are two ways to win a one-day game: by runs, if you bat first and score more runs than the other guys, or by wickets, if you bat second and score more runs than the other guys: at the moment where the second team has more runs, the game ends, and the result is given as “won by 6 wickets with 12 balls remaining”, or similar.</description>

      <description>This morning’s Heritage Walk was in Kensington Market. I grabbed a few photos.
This is the Church of St Stephen-in-the-Fields, on College between Spadina and Bathurst:
Though it is now thoroughly of downtown, when it was built (1857), it was literally in the fields. However, its mission is still the same as it was, to help new immigrants and those of the area that need help. This was a theme of the walk: the various waves of immigrants who settled the area built institutions to help their fellows out.</description>

      <description>Back in 1973, when the American League introduced the Designated Hitter rule, they were worried (among other things) about their league having fewer runs per game than the rival National League. So they introduced a rule whereby the pitcher (or any other nominated player) no longer had to bat, to be replaced by a player, the Designated Hitter, whose only job was to bat. Did that have the desired effect of increasing the total number of runs scored, compared to the National League, which has never had a Designated Hitter?</description>

      <description>Introduction Carter and Guthrie, in 2004, proposed a method of modelling cricket matches. Their aim was to provide an alternative method of deciding interrupted matches, in the manner of Duckworth and Lewis. What was interesting to me is that they estimate a probability of winning (which is then held fixed over interruptions), and it seemed to me that one could estimate and update the probability of winning as the game progresses, which would be a useful adjunct for spectators.</description>

I tried a number of other things before that that didn’t work, in case you think I’m any kind of genius.</description>

      <description>While waiting for my coffee at work this morning, I was leafing through a recreational mathematics journal. It said, “the numbers 1–9 are arranged at random in a 3 by 3 matrix. What is the probability that the row sums and column sums are all odd?”
Well, I thought, that ought to be easy enough to simulate. Randomly shuffle the numbers 1–9 using sample, and then insert them into a matrix with three columns.</description>

      <description>I just discovered a couple of things:
an R Studio add-in called CRANsearcher that, when you run it, prompts you for search terms and searches the whole of CRAN for anything that matches those search terms. (Thanks to @juliasilge on Twitter for this.) To install:  devtools::install_github(&amp;quot;RhoInc/CRANsearcher&amp;quot;) This inspired me to see what else was on my AddIns menu in R Studio. I also found options for creating a new blog post and “serving the site” so I can preview it.</description>

 When the wind is blowing from the west, don’t ride out to the east!
My new phone now has Human on it, which works better than on the tablet (so I uninstalled it from there). This is a screenshot of the map I had on the phone. The advantage is that I only need to take my phone with me (which I would do anyway); the disadvantage is that the map comes out smaller.</description>

      <description>Introduction The standard analysis of variance based on the \(F\)-test has two major assumptions:
Normally distributed data Equal variance within each group.  The analysis can handle a certain amount of non-normality, but the equal-variance assumption is important because it is required for the idea of “an” error variance to make sense (that is what the error mean square is estimating).
Is it possible to make an ANOVA that can allow for the groups to have different variances?</description>

First we need to load the tidyverse:

 From Broadview station, across past the Pizza Pizza, and (carefully) across the entrance ramp to the DVP, and then down the “secret” path:
 crossing the entrance ramp on a rather dilapidated-looking bridge:
 I am never quite sure about the next bit. Today, there was a tent hidden in the trees, as if someone was living back there.</description>

      <description>Last night, Megan and I went to the first ever home game of the Toronto Wolfpack. We got there early and grabbed seats about seven rows up from the field (general admission), so we were close enough to be near the action and yet high enough to get a sense of the flow of the game.
The opposition were a mid-table Oxford side, and as I said to Megan before the game, it’s not whether the Wolfpack would win, but by how many (the answer in the end was 62-12).</description>

The walk around the back of the residences was still passable this afternoon. Here is the substation and dilapidated truck mentioned elsewhere:
 I wondered what this was in the woods, until I remembered that this is a university and there are usually unusual art projects in unusual places. This was just around the corner from the substation:</description>

      <description>For my last post, I had a lot of trouble finding out how to make the images appear.

Here is a picture I took at a spot surprisingly close to where I live, in November last year:</description>

      <description>A short walk today around the back of the S wing at UTSC.
This is the side of the S wing that nobody sees; it has the concrete brutalism of the outside wall (no entrances from this side) up against the forest that leads down to Highland Creek. You don’t meet too many people around here. The path is actually perfectly passable, though there is one low spot that gets muddy.</description>

      <description>So I was at Yorkdale, with no subway south. So I figured I’d arrange a walk and see how far I got. I rode the shuttle bus to Lawrence West, seeing at first hand how ill-suited Toronto is to the car: onto the Allen, a long lineup to turn left onto Lawrence (for us, to get in front of the subway station) and a zoo of cars on Lawrence, including a line of cars waiting to turn left onto the northbound Allen and blocking one of the eastbound through lanes in the process.</description>

      <title>Summarizing several models using broom and purrr</title>

      <description>Introduction broom is supposed to be a powerful way to summarize several models at once, and so it is. The trouble is, the examples show how to fit the same model to different subsets of a data set. I had something different in mind: I had one data set, and three different models on that same data. Could I do something similar there? It wasn’t clear to me how.
 Illustrative data The data here came from Albright’s book.</description>

      <description>Introduction I thought summarizing columns in the tidyverse was kind of clunky, at least until a couple of days ago. Let’s read in some data to illustrate what I thought I had to do. This data comes from the Australian Institute for Sport; it’s body measurements from male and female athletes who play ten different sports.

      <description>Playing with a new look, thanks to this.
One of the main reasons I’m trying this is ⊕the possibility of making side comments on the side (look right).
Ho ho ho.
This is a new thought apparently.

      <title>Cricket: wins by adjusted runs</title>

      <guid>/2017/06/28/cricket-wins-by-adjusted-runs/</guid>
      <description>In cricket, there are two ways to win a one-day game: by runs, if you bat first and score more runs than the other guys, or by wickets, if you bat second and score more runs than the other guys: at the moment where the second team has more runs, the game ends, and the result is given as “won by 6 wickets with 12 balls remaining”, or similar.
Soccer has a tiebreaker “goal difference”: when two teams have the same number of points, you subtract the goals conceded from the goals scored for each team, and the team with the bigger number is placed higher.</description>

      <description>This morning’s Heritage Walk was in Kensington Market. I grabbed a few photos.
This is the Church of St Stephen-in-the-Fields, on College between Spadina and Bathurst:
 Though it is now thoroughly of downtown, when it was built (1857), it was literally in the fields. However, its mission is still the same as it was, to help new immigrants and those of the area that need help. This was a theme of the walk: the various waves of immigrants who settled the area built institutions to help their fellows out.</description>

      <guid>/2017/06/08/the-designated-hitter/</guid>
      <description>Back in 1973, when the American League introduced the Designated Hitter rule, they were worried (among other things) about their league having fewer runs per game than the rival National League. So they introduced a rule whereby the pitcher (or any other nominated player) no longer had to bat, to be replaced by a player, the Designated Hitter, whose only job was to bat. Did that have the desired effect of increasing the total number of runs scored, compared to the National League, which has never had a Designated Hitter?</description>

      <description>Introduction Carter and Guthrie, in 2004, proposed a method of modelling cricket matches. Their aim was to provide an alternative method of deciding interrupted matches, in the manner of Duckworth and Lewis. What was interesting to me is that they estimate a probability of winning (which is then held fixed over interruptions), and it seemed to me that one could estimate and update the probability of winning as the game progresses, which would be a useful adjunct for spectators.</description>

      <description>I seem to have Disqus comments enabled now. The crucial thing appeared to be the disqus.html file written by Yihui Xie. I changed the disqus shortname given there to mine, added my shortname to the disqusShortname in config.toml, and it seems to work.
I tried a number of other things before that that didn’t work, in case you think I’m any kind of genius.</description>

      <description>While waiting for my coffee at work this morning, I was leafing through a recreational mathematics journal. It said, “the numbers 1–9 are arranged at random in a 3 by 3 matrix. What is the probability that the row sums and column sums are all odd?”
Well, I thought, that ought to be easy enough to simulate. Randomly shuffle the numbers 1–9 using sample, and then insert them into a matrix with three columns.</description>

      <description>I just discovered a couple of things:
an R Studio add-in called CRANsearcher that, when you run it, prompts you for search terms and searches the whole of CRAN for anything that matches those search terms. (Thanks to @juliasilge on Twitter for this.)
 This inspired me to see what else was on my AddIns menu in R Studio. I also found options for creating a new blog post and “serving the site” so I can preview it.</description>

      <description>I suppose I should have ridden Victoria Park on Victoria Day, but I didn’t:
 When the wind is blowing from the west, don’t ride out to the east!
My new phone now has Human on it, which works better than on the tablet (so I uninstalled it from there). This is a screenshot of the map I had on the phone. The advantage is that I only need to take my phone with me (which I would do anyway); the disadvantage is that the map comes out smaller.</description>

      <guid>/2017/05/19/welch-analysis-of-variance/</guid>
      <description>Introduction The standard analysis of variance based on the \(F\)-test has two major assumptions:
Normally distributed data Equal variance within each group.  The analysis can handle a certain amount of non-normality, but the equal-variance assumption is important because it is required for the idea of “an” error variance to make sense (that is what the error mean square is estimating).
Is it possible to make an ANOVA that can allow for the groups to have different variances?</description>

I wanted to share something about drawing scatterplots against many variables at once, using gather, ggplot and facet_wrap from the tidyverse.
First we need to load the tidyverse:

      <description>Today’s walk comes in two parts, with a pause for lunch between. Part 1:
 From Broadview station, across past the Pizza Pizza, and (carefully) across the entrance ramp to the DVP, and then down the “secret” path:
 crossing the entrance ramp on a rather dilapidated-looking bridge:
 I am never quite sure about the next bit. Today, there was a tent hidden in the trees, as if someone was living back there.</description>

      <description>Last night, Megan and I went to the first ever home game of the Toronto Wolfpack. We got there early and grabbed seats about seven rows up from the field (general admission), so we were close enough to be near the action and yet high enough to get a sense of the flow of the game.
The opposition were a mid-table Oxford side, and as I said to Megan before the game, it’s not whether the Wolfpack would win, but by how many (the answer in the end was 62-12).</description>

      <description>An even shorter walk around campus today than yesterday; you will see why from the pictures.
The walk around the back of the residences was still passable this afternoon. Here is the substation and dilapidated truck mentioned elsewhere:
 I wondered what this was in the woods, until I remembered that this is a university and there are usually unusual art projects in unusual places. This was just around the corner from the substation:</description>

      <description>For my last post, I had a lot of trouble finding out how to make the images appear. It turns out that the secret is to save them in the static folder, and then to treat that folder as the “root” (that is, start its name with a forward slash) when making the R Markdown for the image. Here is a picture I took at a spot surprisingly close to where I live, in November last year:</description>

      <description>A short walk today around the back of the S wing at UTSC.
This is the side of the S wing that nobody sees; it has the concrete brutalism of the outside wall (no entrances from this side) up against the forest that leads down to Highland Creek. You don’t meet too many people around here. The path is actually perfectly passable, though there is one low spot that gets muddy.</description>

As if that weren’t enough, posting content to this blog is done via R Studio.

      <description>So I was at Yorkdale, with no subway south. So I figured I’d arrange a walk and see how far I got. I rode the shuttle bus to Lawrence West, seeing at first hand how ill-suited Toronto is to the car: onto the Allen, a long lineup to turn left onto Lawrence (for us, to get in front of the subway station) and a zoo of cars on Lawrence, including a line of cars waiting to turn left onto the northbound Allen and blocking one of the eastbound through lanes in the process.</description>

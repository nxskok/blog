      <description>On a dare from @dataandme and @littlemissdata, last night I bought the domain ritsokiguess.site, and now this blog lives there (as well as at the old nxskok.github.io, which is the “actual” home for the site). I used, extensively, the guide here, for which many thanks. There seems to need to be a two-way connection between where the static website actually lives, and where it looks to the outside world as if it lives.</description>

      <description>Introduction Today on Twitter I learned (or was reminded about) two #rstats things:
from @pkqstr about separate_rows from tidyr, that does something like separate followed by gather, but better. from @ma_salmon about haven for reading in data files from other software, and I thought about rio that does more or less the same thing, but more generally.  I didn’t come up with an answer to Maëlle’s question of why haven worked less well for me than rio a long time ago.</description>

      <description>Introduction I don’t know yet where this post is going. Think of it, for now, as a ramble through cluster analysis. I may eventually figure out what to do with it, but I don’t want to delete what I have written just yet.
Hierarchical clustering is a way of forming groups or “clusters” of like individuals. The various forms of hierarchical clustering work from distances or dissimilarilities between individuals. The process is to start from each individual in a cluster by itself and then to join the closest pair of clusters one by one until all individuals are in a single cluster.</description>

      <description>Introduction I learned Stan a while back, when I was fitting some Bayesian models. I wanted to fix up one of them, and I realized that I had forgotten most of what I knew about Stan, so I had to go back and learn it again.
A Bayesian model has two parts: a prior distribution, which summarizes your belief about the parameters you are trying to estimate before you look at any data, and a model that asserts the data-generating mechanism conditional on the parameter value(s).</description>

      <guid>/2018/02/23/making-a-lot-of-plots-all-at-once-the-tidyverse-way/</guid>
      <description>Introduction I was thinking the other day about how you might come up with a bunch of separate-but-related plots, without plotting them one by one, for example to show a class.
By way of example, suppose we want to plot a number of Poisson distributions with different means, so that we can compare their shapes. The textbook says that a Poisson with a large mean is “approximately normal”, but that is just words until you see it on a picture.</description>

      <guid>/2018/01/30/tidy-simple-effects-in-analysis-of-variance/</guid>
      <description>Introduction In two-way analysis of variance, the (continuous) response variable depends on two explanatory factors, say A and B. These factors might have an additive effect, in which case you can talk unambiguously about “the effect of factor A”, but the effect of factor A might be different depending on what level of factor B you are looking at. In that case, factors A and B are said to have an interaction.</description>

      <guid>/2018/01/20/displaying-grouped-bar-charts-in-ggplot/</guid>
      <description>Introduction When you have two categorical variables to plot, grouped bar charts are one possible visualization. I learned something new about them today, from Hadley Wickham himself (well, via a tweet, anyway).
As an example, let’s use some data from the Australian Institute for Sport:

      <description>Introduction Thomas Lin Pedersen is the author of a lot of packages, including two that deal with graphs (in the sense of networks), tidygraph for storing and handling graphs, and ggraph for drawing them, ggplot-style. I have a feeling I will be spending a lot of time with tidygraph, but in this post, I get my feet wet reading in and storing a graph and then making a picture of it.</description>

      <guid>/2017/12/30/installing-r-3-4-on-your-android-phone/</guid>
      <description>Introduction David Selby, on his blog, explains how to get R up and running on your Android phone (and, by way of proof, wrote the blog post concerned on his phone). Unfortunately, however, he was only able to install R 3.1.1, which means that some of the latest tidyverse goodies are not available. Can we do better? It is possible. Maybe.
 Installation on the Android phone We begin by installing two Android apps, which can both be found on Google Play.</description>

      <description>Introduction I have long been interested in drawing maps, and when I discovered how to do it in R, I have tried to add it to my statistical repertoire, including drawing things on maps. There are two packages that can be used to obtain maps and draw on them, ggmap which is based on Google Maps, and OpenStreetMap which is based on Open Street Maps (surprisingly enough). They have overlapping capabilities, which we will explore here.</description>

      <guid>/2017/12/16/testing-for-time-trend/</guid>
      <description>Introduction One of the things my environmental science colleagues spend much of their time doing is assessing whether something is changing over time. Most commonly, the depressing conclusion from one of their investigations is “climate change”. One of the studies I was part of concerned temporal trends in sea ice in Hudson Bay. We will see some of that data later on.
There are two major tools that environmental scientists typically use to assess trend:</description>

      <guid>/2017/11/23/tidying-weather-data/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Weather data often comes in an untidy format that is suitable for looking at, but not so suitable for doing any kind of analysis with. Let’s have a look at the kind of thing I mean. But before we do that, we need a package or two:
library(tidyverse) ## ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.2.1 ── ## ✔ ggplot2 2.2.1 ✔ purrr 0.2.4 ## ✔ tibble 1.3.4 ✔ dplyr 0.</description>

      <description>Introduction We are very accustomed to journey planners that help us navigate across the city, the country or the world. Google’s transit directions are an example: you enter a start and an end point, and it tells you which vehicles to get and where to transfer to another one. Nowadays, this is a commonplace. But back in 1989, the idea of “shortest path” was an idea in the minds of graph theorists, not a practical way to get from one place to another.</description>

      <guid>/2017/09/18/scraping-a-bar-chart-with-rvest/</guid>
      <description>Introduction In cricket, a Manhattan chart records how many runs a team score in each over (and how many wickets fall). An example is here (scroll down to find it). Is it possible to extract the numbers of runs and wickets for each team from this graph?
The answer turns out to be “yes”, because this graph is an SVG graphic, and the data used to create it is embedded in the HTML code, so it is “simply” a matter of pulling it out.</description>

      <description>Introduction You know how, when you’re reading documentation, you nod sagely as you read some part, but when you come back to it later, you realize that you really don’t understand it at all. This happened to me with the purrr documentation. I mean, I could manage map and some of its variants, but when it came down to it, I really had no clue about safely and possibly. Until today, when I actually had a reason to study them.</description>

      <description>Introduction Let’s suppose we are trying to find the median of a bunch of binomial distributions. ⊕This is a simplified version of an actual problem I had, but that one fails for some unconnected (and thus far unknown) reason, so I don’t want to show you that.
To be specific, let’s suppose we have these values of \(n\):
n=c(10,15,20) and these values of \(p\):
p=c(0.25,0.3,0.42) We’ll need the tidyverse, as usual:</description>

      <guid>/2017/07/22/how-to-measure-the-height-of-a-tree/</guid>
      <description>Introduction In a previous post, I was trying to estimate the volume of wood in a tree from its diameter, and I noted that it would be an advantage to know the height of the tree: for example, we could pretend the tree was cone-shaped, or use a power-law-type relationship in which we estimate the best powers of diameter and height to use to estimate volume.
Which made me wonder, how do you measure the height of a tree anyway?</description>

      <guid>/2017/07/20/summarizing-several-models-using-broom-and-purrr/</guid>
      <description>Introduction broom is supposed to be a powerful way to summarize several models at once, and so it is. The trouble is, the examples show how to fit the same model to different subsets of a data set. I had something different in mind: I had one data set, and three different models on that same data. Could I do something similar there? It wasn’t clear to me how.
 Illustrative data The data here came from Albright’s book.</description>

      <description>Introduction I thought summarizing columns in the tidyverse was kind of clunky, at least until a couple of days ago. Let’s read in some data to illustrate what I thought I had to do. This data comes from the Australian Institute for Sport; it’s body measurements from male and female athletes who play ten different sports.

      <guid>/2017/06/28/cricket-wins-by-adjusted-runs/</guid>
      <description>In cricket, there are two ways to win a one-day game: by runs, if you bat first and score more runs than the other guys, or by wickets, if you bat second and score more runs than the other guys: at the moment where the second team has more runs, the game ends, and the result is given as “won by 6 wickets with 12 balls remaining”, or similar.
Soccer has a tiebreaker “goal difference”: when two teams have the same number of points, you subtract the goals conceded from the goals scored for each team, and the team with the bigger number is placed higher.</description>

      <description>This morning’s Heritage Walk was in Kensington Market. I grabbed a few photos.
This is the Church of St Stephen-in-the-Fields, on College between Spadina and Bathurst:
Though it is now thoroughly of downtown, when it was built (1857), it was literally in the fields. However, its mission is still the same as it was, to help new immigrants and those of the area that need help. This was a theme of the walk: the various waves of immigrants who settled the area built institutions to help their fellows out.</description>

      <description>Back in 1973, when the American League introduced the Designated Hitter rule, they were worried (among other things) about their league having fewer runs per game than the rival National League. So they introduced a rule whereby the pitcher (or any other nominated player) no longer had to bat, to be replaced by a player, the Designated Hitter, whose only job was to bat. Did that have the desired effect of increasing the total number of runs scored, compared to the National League, which has never had a Designated Hitter?</description>

      <description>Introduction Carter and Guthrie, in 2004, proposed a method of modelling cricket matches. Their aim was to provide an alternative method of deciding interrupted matches, in the manner of Duckworth and Lewis. What was interesting to me is that they estimate a probability of winning (which is then held fixed over interruptions), and it seemed to me that one could estimate and update the probability of winning as the game progresses, which would be a useful adjunct for spectators.</description>

      <description>Estimating the parameters Start, as ever, with the tidyverse, along with MASS for modelling later:

      <description>I seem to have Disqus comments enabled now. The crucial thing appeared to be the disqus.html file written by Yihui Xie. I changed the disqus shortname given there to mine, added my shortname to the disqusShortname in config.toml, and it seems to work.
I tried a number of other things before that that didn’t work, in case you think I’m any kind of genius.</description>

      <description>While waiting for my coffee at work this morning, I was leafing through a recreational mathematics journal. It said, “the numbers 1–9 are arranged at random in a 3 by 3 matrix. What is the probability that the row sums and column sums are all odd?”
Well, I thought, that ought to be easy enough to simulate. Randomly shuffle the numbers 1–9 using sample, and then insert them into a matrix with three columns.</description>

      <description>I just discovered a couple of things:
an R Studio add-in called CRANsearcher that, when you run it, prompts you for search terms and searches the whole of CRAN for anything that matches those search terms. (Thanks to @juliasilge on Twitter for this.) To install:  devtools::install_github(&amp;quot;RhoInc/CRANsearcher&amp;quot;) This inspired me to see what else was on my AddIns menu in R Studio. I also found options for creating a new blog post and “serving the site” so I can preview it.</description>

      <description>I suppose I should have ridden Victoria Park on Victoria Day, but I didn’t:
 When the wind is blowing from the west, don’t ride out to the east!
My new phone now has Human on it, which works better than on the tablet (so I uninstalled it from there). This is a screenshot of the map I had on the phone. The advantage is that I only need to take my phone with me (which I would do anyway); the disadvantage is that the map comes out smaller.</description>

      <description>Introduction The standard analysis of variance based on the \(F\)-test has two major assumptions:
Normally distributed data Equal variance within each group.  The analysis can handle a certain amount of non-normality, but the equal-variance assumption is important because it is required for the idea of “an” error variance to make sense (that is what the error mean square is estimating).
Is it possible to make an ANOVA that can allow for the groups to have different variances?</description>

      <description>Introduction An R post here.
I wanted to share something about drawing scatterplots against many variables at once, using gather, ggplot and facet_wrap from the tidyverse.
First we need to load the tidyverse:
library(tidyverse) ## Loading tidyverse: ggplot2 ## Loading tidyverse: tibble ## Loading tidyverse: tidyr ## Loading tidyverse: readr ## Loading tidyverse: purrr ## Loading tidyverse: dplyr ## Conflicts with tidy packages ---------------------------------------------- ## filter(): dplyr, stats ## lag(): dplyr, stats  Gather Let’s start with gather.</description>

      <description>Today’s walk comes in two parts, with a pause for lunch between. Part 1:
 From Broadview station, across past the Pizza Pizza, and (carefully) across the entrance ramp to the DVP, and then down the “secret” path:
 crossing the entrance ramp on a rather dilapidated-looking bridge:
 I am never quite sure about the next bit. Today, there was a tent hidden in the trees, as if someone was living back there.</description>

      <description>Last night, Megan and I went to the first ever home game of the Toronto Wolfpack. We got there early and grabbed seats about seven rows up from the field (general admission), so we were close enough to be near the action and yet high enough to get a sense of the flow of the game.
The opposition were a mid-table Oxford side, and as I said to Megan before the game, it’s not whether the Wolfpack would win, but by how many (the answer in the end was 62-12).</description>

      <description>An even shorter walk around campus today than yesterday; you will see why from the pictures.
The walk around the back of the residences was still passable this afternoon. Here is the substation and dilapidated truck mentioned elsewhere:
 I wondered what this was in the woods, until I remembered that this is a university and there are usually unusual art projects in unusual places. This was just around the corner from the substation:</description>

      <description>For my last post, I had a lot of trouble finding out how to make the images appear. It turns out that the secret is to save them in the static folder, and then to treat that folder as the “root” (that is, start its name with a forward slash) when making the R Markdown for the image. Here is a picture I took at a spot surprisingly close to where I live, in November last year:</description>

      <description>A short walk today around the back of the S wing at UTSC.
This is the side of the S wing that nobody sees; it has the concrete brutalism of the outside wall (no entrances from this side) up against the forest that leads down to Highland Creek. You don’t meet too many people around here. The path is actually perfectly passable, though there is one low spot that gets muddy.</description>

As if that weren’t enough, posting content to this blog is done via R Studio. I created a new project called blog that is linked to a Github repository, and installed the blogdown package (by the amazingly prolific Yihui Xie), and then I create a new post such as this one by, at the console, typing</description>

      <description>So I was at Yorkdale, with no subway south. So I figured I’d arrange a walk and see how far I got. I rode the shuttle bus to Lawrence West, seeing at first hand how ill-suited Toronto is to the car: onto the Allen, a long lineup to turn left onto Lawrence (for us, to get in front of the subway station) and a zoo of cars on Lawrence, including a line of cars waiting to turn left onto the northbound Allen and blocking one of the eastbound through lanes in the process.</description>

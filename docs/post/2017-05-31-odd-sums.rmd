While waiting for my coffee at work this morning, I was leafing through a recreational mathematics journal. It said, "the numbers 1--9 are arranged at random in a 3 \times 3 matrix. What is the probability that the row sums and column sums are all odd?"

Well, I thought, that ought to be easy enough to simulate. Randomly shuffle the numbers 1--9 using `sample`, and then insert them into a matrix with three columns. Calculate the row and column sums using `apply`, glue them together into one long vector, and test whether all of the values have remainder 1 when divided by 2 (a fancy way of saying "odd"). That led to this function:

```{r}
isodd=function(isprint=F) {
  x=sample(1:9)
  m=matrix(x,ncol=3)
  if (isprint) print(m)
  rowsums=apply(m,1,sum)
  colsums=apply(m,2,sum)
  v=(c(rowsums,colsums) %% 2)
  all(v==1)
}
```

I also put in an argument `isprint` that, if true, displays the randomly-generated matrix of shuffled values (for use when checking). So, let's see how it works, setting the random number seed for reproducibility:

```{r}
set.seed(1)
isodd(T)
isodd(T)
isodd(T)
isodd(T)
```

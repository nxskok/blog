<p>On a dare from <span class="citation">@dataandme</span> and <span class="citation">@littlemissdata</span>, last night I bought the domain <code>ritsokiguess.site</code>, and now this blog lives there (as well as at the old <a href="http://nxskok.github.io">nxskok.github.io</a>, which is the “actual” home for the site). I used, extensively, <a href="http://blog.brooke.science/posts/custom-domain-hosting-with-github-and-namecheap/">Brooke Watson’s guide</a>, for which many thanks. There seems to need to be a two-way connection between where the static website actually lives, and where it looks to the outside world as if it lives.</p>
<p>I guess I now have to call my blog “R, it’s OK I guess”, which would be a delicious ironical thingy.</p>

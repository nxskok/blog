I seem to have Disqus comments enabled now. The crucial thing appeared to be the disqus.html file [written by Yihui Xie](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/52). I changed the disqus shortname given there to mine, added my shortname to the disqusShortname in config.toml, and it seems to work.

I tried a number of other things before that that didn't work, in case you think I'm any kind of genius.

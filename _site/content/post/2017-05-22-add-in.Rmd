I just discovered a couple of things:

1. an R Studio add-in called `CRANsearcher` that, when you run it, prompts you for search terms and searches the whole of CRAN for anything that matches those search terms. (Thanks to @juliasilge on Twitter for this.) To install:

```{r, eval=F}
devtools::install_github("RhoInc/CRANsearcher")
```


2. This inspired me to see what else was on my AddIns menu in R Studio. I also found options for creating a new blog post and "serving the site" so I can preview it. 
Unfortunately it adds the extension `.rmd` instead of `.Rmd`. I had to manually change it. But it does put things in the right folders.

I should look there more often.

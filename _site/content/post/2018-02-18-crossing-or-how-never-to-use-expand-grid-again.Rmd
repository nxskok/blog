## Packages 

The usual:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


## Introduction

Let's use some data on Australian elite athletes, which can be found here:

```{r}
athletes = read_tsv("http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/c32/ais.txt")
athletes
```

There are 202 athletes, on whom are measured 13 variables, some categorical (such as the gender of the athlete or the sport they play), the rest quantitative (like height and weight).

## Predicting weight from height and gender

To illustrate the kind of thing we might do, let's do a regression to predict weight from height and gender:

```{r}
weight.1=lm(Wt~Ht+Sex,data=athletes)
summary(weight.1)
```

`Ht` and `Sex` are both significant; taking note of the units of measurement, being 1 centimetre taller is associated with almost exactly 1 kg more weight (regardless of gender, according to the model), and being male rather than female is associated with 4.4 kg more weight (regardless of height, but comparing a male and a female of the same height).

To understand this model better, let's do some predictions. For this, I like to use combinations of values of the explanatory variables, which helps me understand their effect. Let's use the median and quartiles of height and the two genders. The five-number summary of height is

```{r}
quantile(athletes$Ht)
```


The obvious way to do this is via `expand.grid`:

```{r}
heights=c(174,180,186)
sexes=c("female","male")
new=expand.grid(Ht=heights,Sex=sexes)
new
class(new$Sex)
```

This makes all combinations of the three heights and two genders all right, but even though the values in `sexes` were text, they have been turned into a `factor`. This might be all right in a regression, but in other cases it might not be, and then you would have to use the infamous `stringsAsFactors` to keep it as text.

Instead of that, we can use `crossing` from `tidyr`, which, like other tidyverse tools, only creates factors if you ask it to. Using the `heights` and `sexes` from above:

```{r}
new=crossing(Ht=heights,Sex=sexes)
new
```

and now `Sex` is text. 

`r tufte::margin_note("There is a technicality here: expand.grid varies the first thing fastest, while crossing varies the last thing fastest.")`

I gave `new` precisely the same column names as the variables in the regression so that I could predict weight for athletes of these heights and genders:

```{r}
pred=predict(weight.1,new)
new %>% bind_cols(pred_weight=pred)
```

This shows predicted weight for athletes of "typical" heights and both genders. If you compare the same height but different genders, the male is predicted to be heavier by just over 4 kg, and if you increase height in steps of 6 cm (for the same gender), for example looking at the first, third and fifth rows, the predicted weight goes up by almost exactly 6 kg each time. This confirms what we saw by looking at the slopes, but I think it is much more obvious here that this is the way the relationship plays out.

`r tufte::margin_note("In things like ordinal logistic regression, the slopes are harder to interpret. In that case, I like to do predicted probabilities for representative values of the explanatory variables, and looking at *those* makes it easier to see what the model is telling me.")`

I ought to have drawn a graph first, but I'll draw one now:

```{r}
ggplot(athletes,aes(x=Ht,y=Wt,colour=Sex))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method="lm",se=F)
```

As you would expect, the males are mostly taller and heavier than the females, but the relationship between height and weight within gender is not obviously nonlinear, and the regression lines for males and females are very close to parallel (so that there is no need for an interaction term). This allows us the simple interpretation of additive effects of height and of gender on weight.

## Gender and sport played

The data set includes a column showing which sport these elite athletes play. What sports are there, and which genders play them? With two categorical variables, a grouped bar chart is the way to go. To produce that in `ggplot`, one of the categorical variables is `x` and the other one is `fill`:

```{r}
ggplot(athletes,aes(x=Sport,fill=Sex))+geom_bar(position="dodge")
```

The `position="dodge"` is to put the bars for each sport side by side, which I like better than stacked (which is the default). It is better to put the categorical variable that has fewer levels as the `fill`, since otherwise you get a lot of different colours to disentangle.

This chart shows that some of the sports are played by males and females in about equal numbers, some of them are played mostly by one gender, and some are played *only* by one gender. These bars come out double-width. I found out how to fix this at <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10326729/dont-drop-zero-count-dodged-barplot>, S_BRT's answer:

```{r}
ggplot(athletes,aes(x=Sport,fill=Sex))+
  geom_bar(position=position_dodge(preserve="single"))
```


Another way to see that some of the gender-sport combinations are empty is to count them:

```{r}
athletes %>% count(Sport,Sex)
```

Even though there are 10 sports and two genders, so there ought to be $2 \times 10=20$ combinations, there are only 17 rows here, because the three missing ones with zero frequencies are not shown. How can we make all 20 combinations? The key is a cousin of `crossing` called `expand`:

```{r}
athletes %>% expand(Sport,Sex)
```

This gets all 20 combinations, *regardless of whether there are any values in the data set or not*.

The difference between `crossing` and `expand` is that the former *makes* combinations out of vectors that you supply (of the categories or values whose combinations you want), while `expand` makes combinations out of values already in a data frame, of which there might be repeats.

It seems more `tidyverse` to make a data frame of the values you want all combinations of, but each column of a data frame has to have the same number of rows, and the things you want combinations of won't necessarily have the same number of each (as in our height and gender example above). So the natural way is to put the values in separate vectors and *make* a data frame of combinations using `crossing`.

If what you really want is only those combinations that exist in the data, you can get that using `expand` also:

```{r}
athletes %>% expand(nesting(Sport,Sex))
```

and once again there are only 17 rows.

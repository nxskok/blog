I suppose I should have ridden Victoria Park on Victoria Day, but I didn't:

When the wind is blowing from the west, don't ride out to the east!

My new phone now has Human on it, which works better than on the tablet (so I uninstalled it from there). This is a screenshot of the map I had on the phone. The advantage is that I only need to take my phone with me (which I would do anyway); the disadvantage is that the map comes out smaller.

Human is tied in with Google Fit, so I guess I can look there (on the computer) and see what the map looks like:

Yeah, better.

Also, think I need a new inner tube. The rear wheel has been starting rides with air and ending them without. That means I have to remember how to get the rear tire off, which I always have trouble with.

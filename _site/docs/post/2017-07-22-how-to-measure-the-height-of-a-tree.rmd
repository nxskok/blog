## Introduction

In a previous post, I was trying to estimate the volume of wood in a tree from its diameter, and I noted that it would be an advantage to know the height of the tree: for example, we could pretend the tree was cone-shaped, or use a power-law-type relationship in which we estimate the best powers of diameter and height to use to estimate volume.

Which made me wonder, how *do* you measure the height of a tree anyway? [This](https://gabrielhemery.com/2011/05/15/how-to-calculate-tree-height-using-a-smartphone/) made a lot of sense (and taught me how to use a clinometer app, of which more later). [This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_height_measurement) contained more detail, including a second method that I want to talk about. In addition, I learned about Tikz: how to use it to draw a nice diagram, and how to get said diagram to work with R Markdown and show up in this post.

## A tree and a human, diagrammatically

Here is an idealized tree (on the right) with an idealized human (on the left) trying to measure it.

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]
  \draw (0,0) -- (0,1);
  \draw (3,0) -- (3,6);
  \draw (0,0) -- (3,0);
  \draw (0,1) -- (3,0);
  \draw (0,1) -- (3,6);
  \draw (0,1) -- (3,1);
  % vertices
  \node[left] at (0,1) {E};
  \node[left] at (0,0) {F};
  \node[right] at (3,6) {A};
  \node[right] at (3,1) {B};
  \node[right] at (3,0) {C};
  % line lengths
  \node[below] at (1.5,0) {$d$};
  \node[above] at (1.5,1) {$d$};
  \node[right] at (0,0.5) {$k$};
  \node[left] at (3,0.5) {$k$};
  \node[right] at (3,3.5) {$h$};
  % angles
  \node[above right] at (0.1,1) {$\theta$};
  \node[below right] at (0.5,1.05) {$\phi$};
\end{tikzpicture}

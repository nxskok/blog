<p>I seem to have Disqus comments enabled now. The crucial thing appeared to be the disqus.html file that Yihui Xie wrote at !(<a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/52" class="uri">https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/52</a>). I changed the disqus shortname given there to mine, added my shortname to the disqusShortname in config.toml, and it seems to work.</p>
<p>I tried a number of other things before that that didn’t work, in case you think I’m any kind of genius.</p>

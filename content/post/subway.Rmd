## Introduction

Toronto's subway network consists of four lines, as shown [here](http://ttc.ca/PDF/Maps/TTC_SubwayMap_2017-12.pdf). The shape of the network is somewhat iconic, with one line going across, and one down and up in a U-shape. 

Let's suppose that all I have is a list of the stations on each line. How could I represent the structure of the network, how could I draw it, and how would my image match up to reality? Let's find out.

## The data

I entered the station names into a file, one after the other, with NA as a special code to mark the end of one line and the beginning of the next, for example:

```{bash}
#head -8 subway.txt
```

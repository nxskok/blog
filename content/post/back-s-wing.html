<p>A short walk today around the back of the S wing at UTSC.</p>

<p>This is the side of the S wing that nobody sees; it has the concrete brutalism of the outside wall (no entrances from this side) up against the forest that leads down to Highland Creek. You donâ€™t meet too many people around here. The path is actually perfectly passable, though there is one low spot that gets muddy. The path actually starts from Ellesmere Road and goes round via a electrical substation attended by an ancient truck and the back of the residences (through the trees) and comes out at the end of the SY building, from which you can go around the familiar inside of the curve of the S-wing (indoors or outdoors) or the unfamiliar outside.</p>
<p>I came back up the steps between the S wing and the H wing. This is the back of the H wing. I once had an office on the 4th floor of the H wing looking down on this:</p>

<p>I am obliged to point out that the top floor you see there is actually the <em>fifth</em> floor, since the H wing joins to the S wing which has an underground first floor.</p>
<p>This is the AA building, with some off-kilter architecture:</p>

<p>and this is the present-day version of my first-ever view of the S wing:</p>

<p>When I came for interview (on the top floor of the S wing), there was no building on the right.</p>

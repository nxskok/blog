<p>I just discovered a couple of things:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>an R Studio add-in called <code>CRANsearcher</code> that, when you run it, prompts you for search terms and searches the whole of CRAN for anything that matches those search terms. (Thanks to <span class="citation">@juliasilge</span> on Twitter for this.)</p></li>
<li><p>This inspired me to see what else was on my AddIns menu in R Studio. I also found options for creating a new blog post and “serving the site” so I can preview it. I should look there more often.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I just discovered a couple of things:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>an R Studio add-in called <code>CRANsearcher</code> that, when you run it, prompts you for search terms and searches the whole of CRAN for anything that matches those search terms. (Thanks to <span class="citation">@juliasilge</span> on Twitter for this.) To install:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>devtools::install_github(&quot;RhoInc/CRANsearcher&quot;)</code></pre>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>This inspired me to see what else was on my AddIns menu in R Studio. I also found options for creating a new blog post and “serving the site” so I can preview it. Unfortunately it adds the extension <code>.rmd</code> instead of <code>.Rmd</code>. I had to manually change it. But it does put things in the right folders.</li>
</ol>
<p>I should look there more often.</p>

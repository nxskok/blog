<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Toronto’s subway network consists of four lines, as shown <a href="http://ttc.ca/PDF/Maps/TTC_SubwayMap_2017-12.pdf">here</a>. The shape of the network is somewhat iconic, with one line going across, and one down and up in a U-shape.</p>
<p>Let’s suppose that all I have is a list of the stations on each line. How could I represent the structure of the network, how could I draw it, and how would my image match up to reality? Let’s find out.</p>

<div id="the-data" class="section level2">
<h2>The data</h2>
<p>I entered the station names into a file, one after the other, with NA as a special code to mark the end of one line and the beginning of the next, for example:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>#head -8 subway.txt</code></pre>

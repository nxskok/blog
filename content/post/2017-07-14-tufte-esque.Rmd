Playing with a new look, thanks to [this](http://livefreeordichotomize.com/2017/07/13/introducing-the-tuftesque-blogdown-theme/). 

One of the main reasons I'm trying this is 
`r tufte::margin_note("the possibility of making side comments on the side")`
(look right).

Ho ho ho.

This `r tufte::newthought("is a new thought")` apparently.

The banner on the front page and the logo at the top of each page (on which you click to get back to the front page) are `r tufte::margin_note("Evidently.")` trains, specifically British Class 156 diesel multiple-unit trains, from which I have seen a lot of Britain.

Let me just generate a random pointless scatterplot: `r tufte::margin_note("First generating some pointless data, and before *that* waiting through the tidyverse's startup messages.")`

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
d=tibble(xx=rnorm(100),yy=rnorm(100))
d
g=ggplot(d,aes(x=xx,y=yy))+geom_point()
g
```

<p>For my last post, I had a lot of trouble finding out how to make the images appear. It turns out that the secret is to save them in the <code>static</code> folder, and then to treat that folder as the “root” (that is, start its name with a forward slash) when making the R Markdown for the image. Here is a picture I took at a spot surprisingly close to where I live, in November last year:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/trees_small.jpg" />

</div>

## Did somebody say dates?

![](/dates.jpg)

Well, actually not those. I meant the other kind.

## Some birth dates

Let's suppose that we have some people and their birth dates, and we want to know how old they are:



```{bash}
cat dates.csv
```

There are three people (who may or may not be real), and their birth dates are expressed two ways, once as year-month-day, and once in English with month names.

We need some packages before we start:

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

## Reading in the data

Reading in using `read_csv` from `readr` turns y-m-d dates into R `Date`s, but leaves other date-like things as text:

```{r}
mydates=read_csv("dates.csv")
mydates
```

## Using `lubridate` to turn that English into dates

To turn those dates in words into actual dates, we need `lubridate`. These are the month, the day and the year in that order, so `mdy` will take care of it. It doesn't matter whether the months are numbers or names:

```{r}
(mydates %>% mutate(date_from_text=mdy(date_words)) -> dates2)
```

Those appear to be the same. Are they?

```{r}
with(dates2,all.equal(date,date_from_text))
```

Yep.

## How old are all these people?

First find the ages by subtracting the dates from today:

```{r}
now=Sys.Date()
now
mydates %>% mutate(age=now-date)
```

These ages are actually stored internally as seconds. This is not very pleasant to look at. (In an R Notebook, `print` chooses what it thinks is an appropriate unit. When I did this before, this was days.)

I would like those ages to be years.

`lubridate` has functions `dminutes`, `ddays`, `dyears` etc that contain the number of seconds in the input number of minutes, days, years etc. So we can calculate a decimal number of years like this:

```{r}
mydates %>% mutate(age=now-date) %>%
  mutate(age_years=age/dyears(1))
```

## Durations and periods

The above are fractional years, "durations" in the `lubridate` jargon. What if we wanted to express them as months instead? The problem is that a month has a variable length, so there is no `dmonths(1)`. What you do instead is to work with "periods", an integer number of somethings plus a remainder. In this way, you can have something like a whole number of months (which is accurate) plus a whole number of days as a remainder.

Let's turn `age` into a period by dividing by `years(1)`, except that this gives a error: 

```{r,error=T}
mydates %>% mutate(age=now-date) %>%
  mutate(age_years=age/years(1))
```

and this doesn't quite fix it:

```{r}
mydates %>% mutate(age=now-date) %>%
  mutate(age_years=as.period(age)/years(1))
```

the answers in `age_years` are slightly different. This is because fractional division doesn't work: years are different lengths.`r tufte::margin_note("If you had a fractional year, *which* year would it be a fraction of?")`
The right way to handle this is with *integer* division, that is, the old-fashioned way with a quotient and a remainder. The code for that looks like this, the remainder being a bit odd, but I'll get to that.

There seem to be lots of warnings:

```{r}
mydates %>% mutate(age=as.period(now-date)) %>%
  mutate(age_years = age %/% years(1), remainder_months = (age %% years(1)) %/% months(1))
```

I turned `age` into a period first. This makes the ages not display properly. To get those ages in (completed) years, integer-divide by `years(1)`. To get the remainder, use `%%` to get the remainder, but that looks funny when you display it, so if we integer-divide *that* by `months(1)`, we get the remainder as a number of (completed) months. (The ten-month birthdays for M and Dad would be in July, and as I write this it is August 4. M's 11th month hasn't quite ticked over yet.)

Let's do the same thing, but now calculate ages in months and days:

```{r}
mydates %>% mutate(age=as.period(now-date)) %>%
  mutate(age_months = age %/% months(1), remainder_days= (age %% months(1)) %/% days(1))
```

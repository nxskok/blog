I discovered that one can host a blog on Github, on which I already have an account, via a thing called Github Pages. As if that weren't enough, posting content to this blog is done via R Studio. I created a new project called `blog` that is linked to a Github repository, and installed the `blogdown` package (by the amazingly prolific [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/)), and then I create a new post such as this one by, at the console, typing


```{r,eval=FALSE}
library(blogdown)
new_post(title="This blog",file="This-blog.Rmd")
```

and then a new R Markdown window pops up, into which I can type any R Markdown (that is, marked-up text plus optional R code). When I'm happy with what I have, I save it, go back to the console, and type

```{r,eval=FALSE}
serve_site()
```

which previews my new post, at least as long as it's in the right folder (still not sure about that).

When it looks all right, I "commit" my changes to Github in the usual way, and then the whole blog appears on Github Pages. It's, almost, magic.

Plus I can generate some random data and draw a histogram of it:

```{r,echo=FALSE,results='hide',message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(1)
```


```{r}
d=data.frame(z=rnorm(1000))
head(d)
d %>% ggplot(aes(x=z))+geom_histogram(bins=10)
```

Pretty bell-curved, I say (as it should be, of course).

Most of the work there was in getting the `tidyverse` startup messages to disappear, but that's another story.

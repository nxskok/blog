<p>I suppose I should have ridden Victoria Park on Victoria Day, but I didn’t:</p>

<p>When the wind is blowing from the west, don’t ride out to the east!</p>
<p>My new phone now has Human on it, which works better than on the tablet (so I uninstalled it from there). This is a screenshot of the map I had on the phone. The advantage is that I only need to take my phone with me (which I would do anyway); the disadvantage is that the map comes out smaller.</p>
<p>Human is tied in with Google Fit, so I guess I can look there (on the computer) and see what the map looks like:</p>

<p>Yeah, better.</p>
<p>Also, think I need a new inner tube. The rear wheel has been starting rides with air and ending them without. That means I have to remember how to get the rear tire off, which I always have trouble with.</p>

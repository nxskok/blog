An even shorter walk around campus today than yesterday; you will see why from the pictures.

The walk around the back of the residences was still passable this afternoon. Here is the substation and dilapidated truck mentioned elsewhere:

I wondered what this was in the woods, until I remembered that this is a university and there are usually unusual art projects in unusual places. This was just around the corner from the substation:

This area (below) suddenly became known as Rock Walk. I don't know when the signs went up, but the area in the background (a pickup circle for students being met in cars) also suddenly acquired the name Scarborough Circle. The rocks are illustrative of, well, something rocky, that I will investigate further when the weather is more cooperative.

Oh, "the principal rock types found across Ontario", it says [here](http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/aboutus/rock-walk).

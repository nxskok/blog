## What I do

Welcome to Ken Butler's website. I teach applied statistics in the [Department of Computer and Mathematical Sciences](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/cms/) at [UTSC](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/home/). 

I have also been known to take in a [Toronto Wolfpack](https://www.torontowolfpack.com/) game from time to time.
